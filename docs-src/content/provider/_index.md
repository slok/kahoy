Kahoy needs two manifest states (old and new) to plan what resources need to exist/gone in the cluster. How these manifests are provided is using the `provider`

| Provider   | Easy | Flexible | Fast | History |
| ---------- | ---- | -------- | ---- | ------- |
| Kubernetes | ✔    | ✔        | ✖    | ✖       |
| Git        | ✖    | ✖        | ✔    | ✔       |
| Paths      | ✖    | ✔        | ✔    | ✖       |
